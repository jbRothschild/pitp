#  Some quantitative problems in the evolution and heterogeneity of human cancers

*Copied from Rabadan Lab: [https://rabadan.c2b2.columbia.edu/pitp]. Datasets can be found there too.*

In this lecture we will study how genomics has enabled the characterization of the genetic lesions that are associated with the initiation and development of human cancers. We will focus on four different open questions where quantitative approaches are needed:

    What are the genes that are responsible for the development of human cancers?

    Can we reconstruct the mutational history of human cancers?

    Can we infer the mutational processes leading to cancer?

    What is the role of tumor heterogeneity and the surrounding cells in the progression of cancers?
